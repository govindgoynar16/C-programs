# 1. Write a python program to sort a dictionary by value.
# a={"a":12,"b":14,"c":22,"d":32,"e":82}
# a=sorted(a.values())
# print(a)
# 2. Write a python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 and the values are square of keys.
# a={}
# for i in range(1,16):
#     a[i]=i**2
# print(a)    
# 3. Write a program to multiply all the items in a dictionary.
# a={"a":12,"b":14,"c":22,"d":32,"e":82}
# product=1
# for i in a:
#     product*=a[i]
# print(product)
